    <p>The author of “ Stop Talking to Each Other and Start Buying Things: Three Decades of Survival in the Desert of Social Media” wrote this essay to explain and educate readers on the dangerous evolution of social media sites and what happens behind the scenes that leads to its erosion. A large vocal point that Valente expressed was that users have a huge role in the development of a social media site and that when social media sites get eroded they hurt the users a lot more than the company owners who would eventually have to sell them for pennies. 
Valente ranted about how the internet was when it first came around and how she used to interact on the social media platforms at the time. Illustrating how the other users on the site and her memories with them were a source of comfort for her and helped her develop her understanding on what social media is meant to be. Throughout the rest of her rant filled essay she shamed capitalism and how it negatively affects social media sites and their users.  </p>  
  <p>I would say that I heavily agree with the many points that she made including the ones about twitter because I would personally say that I have seen how Elon Musk has affected the social media site and its users. While reading the essay Valente pointed out some things that I didn't notice until now; that most heads of social media sites are usually conservative or right wing and their beliefs start to spill onto the site. Which usually results in the users that actually care about what the site was, fighting against the changes and the right wing users. One would think that the site being run by a conservative wouldn't change a social media app as much but it really does when you look at the changes made to twitter. 
 </p>    
  <p>When you look at the current state of twitter… to say that it is hell would be an understatement. Between the numerous advertisements in comment sections or on the pages themselves. The ads would be based on crypto or only fans models. There's also a thing on twitter where people will say extremely problematic things just to get traction and attention on the post. Just to find out that they actually get paid to make content that “triggers” people into commenting and arguing with other users on the platform. Which makes the site less of a community than it originally was. Any time I go on twitter I can scroll and look at every single post and find an argument or a click bait post that gets very close to offensive remarks that should be reported. But due to the freedom of speech (but lack of consequences) you can report the problematic statements but most likely nothing will be done about the things being said. Even if there are actual racist things being said and dehumanization of people, reporting numerous posts that back up your claim will do absolutely nothing. 
          </p>  
<p>Also due to this lack of regulation when it comes to social media this allows any kind of post to be posted. Even with the age limit on twitter being 17+ the type of content on the site is a lot even for a 20 year old. To me twitter is a borderline gore and porn site that the only thing you can’t post on there is anything extremely left. After reading the essay I can understand the way the social media sites go to crap the way that they do and how social media owners can affect their users.
