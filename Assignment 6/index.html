     It was now 5 years after I had gotten this scar on my forehead. Now its just a mark that causes me seizures and manic episodes from time to time. I’m already insane so it's like a booster that kicks in after a while like in a video game. I’m at my 5th school since then and now I’m once again at a new school looking for a new victim. Now that i’m in high school i have to pick someone that I have a few classes with but not too many but I can still create a network of people who can torture them. I can bully some girls with fucked up wigs or some guys with fucked up acne and even greaser hair. During lunch that day a girl sat across from me at the same table. There were only a few of us here since lunch was kinda starting earlier without much notice. 
          But when I looked straight into this girls face and tell me why she looked a LOT like Aaliyah the only difference was her bigger lips, her hair was a lighter color and the same grade of curl as the little boy that came up to me. My face went hot and I quickly looked away when she glanced at me. I moved a few tables away but jesus christ she scared the fuck out of me. Why did she look exactly like Aaliyah, were in a whole different state. Oh my god this has to be my hell. She’s like my personal torture demon. Jesus she better stay away from me. As the day went on I found out that she has an older brother that also goes to this school and he isnt much of a weirdo like she is. He is a point guard for our schools basketball team. He is pretty cute in the face but i dont really care about that stuff unless its to hurt others. 
But we have a few classes together enough on my count to make her my personal victim. I wasnt really convinced yet. Going through the halls I’d like to quickly canvas the halls before class to hear any drama that could be useful at any time but I stumbled into some guys who where bullying, Gabrielle thats what her name was. They were pushing her around and she was right in front of the door to the class I had next. Her brother looked at me and sly smile on his face. A burning feeling erupted in my chest but I pushed it down. He was too handsome for his own good. But I never shouldve looked at Gabrielle’s face because as soon as I did she gave me a scrunched up face. Similar to the last face I saw before my accident. I went paler than Michael Jackson. The only difference was that her face looked weaker, less confident, almost begging for help. 
Jesus, that look made me feel a million feelings. It felt almost better than when I drank hennessy and mixed it with smoking weed. Fire went through my veins making my heart thump irregular and my chest heaved as I laughed so loudly in the hallway. Attracting so much attention to myself but I didn't care. Her face twisted more and it made my laugh get so worse. She never made this face before. It makes me feel so good. Like I successfully started a fight or a war. This is why she is here. To make me feel something good out of the situation I crawled out of. When I snap out of my trance I look up and her brother was in front of me. He told me his name is Devon. Jeez here we go. 
          Jesus, she was beautiful. I ask her name. She is name Jasmine. Of course a beautiful flower. “You look pretty just like the flower. The scar just adds to it.” She smirks at me but the rest of her face is completely unreadable. She's so gorgeous. I tell her and she looks around and tries to walk around me. I grab her arm. Flinching, she snatches her arm back. With that snatch I fell back against the lockers but to me it felt like cupid just shot me fifty times. It felt so amazing. 
	Days later I would see her bully my younger sister. Thats what is so similar about it. Just the way she gets other people to join her. Her gorgeous face. I could stare at it all day. I love looking at her face like that which is why I was humiliating my sister in front of the school often. With Jasmine help it wasnt looked down on as much. Better yet she would smile even more when I joined. Jesus her smile drove me inside and made me so hard. Before Jasmine I used to feel a little bad about the bullying but when she does it I enjoy this especially when I got her number. We text kinda often and I can see her blush through her windows of where she lives. Yea stalking was a bit of a jump but I seriously needed to know if this was one sided. But now that I seen her smile an elegant smile it makes me think. I can change her, make her change her ways, our parents will love her and she will apologize to Gabrielle and all of this can be water under the bridge. 
    I notice all her favorite things. I sneak it in her bag and I give it to her. I get a more pleased reaction when I dont personally hand it to her but its not a fully displeased look. She’s just hiding her feelings. I can be patient. Jesus I wish I could figure out how to torture me and hurt me just like her but instead of looking at me with that wicked smile I want her to look at me with her pretty genuine smile. So I decided one night to conduct a harmless experiment. I hurt my sister, not too much. I took a picture of it. “Oh my god! What did you do to her.” “What I shouldve been doing but I never started until I met you.” She hearted the message. I texted her “Do you want to call soon.”

	<p> To my surprise she called me and asked questions inquiring about me. I won. I figured it out. Next few days I copied my sister's sketchbook and printed out all the stupid fanfiction she wrote. Several copies spread throughout the halls with me and Janiyah making a mess together. Fuck there it was. Her gorgeous smile while she tossed things in the air. Ripping some up and tossing it in my hair. I picked her up and spun her throughout the hallways. Laughing as we ran through the hallways with security behind us trying to get us. I let her in my car and we drive off. I can say we had an amazing date and night after that. Gabrielle had a meltdown in our dining room when she saw Jasmine having breakfast with us and our parents. 
	Surprisingly my parents took my side and yelled at Gabrielle for not being polite at home making her meltdown even more. I was taking her on long rides in my Camaro sometimes Gabrielle in the back to be some alternative amusement. It was perfect. But one day she went somewhere she wasnt supposed to. Looking in my closet to have one of my hoodies she found some panties, her lip gloss, her bonnet and many other things I had taken from her and her home. It started a pretty bad argument and I tried to grovel but she looked at me the same way she looked at Gabrielle minus the large smile. “Just call me when you get home baby.” She ignored me and left. I beat up my sister again and sent her pictures of the aftermath. She left me on read. The gape in my stomach was getting bigger and bigger and I didnt like where this was going. 
	I decided to buy all of her favorite things. My mother made  the crepes she loves. I also bought some beautiful flowers. When I saw her in the hallway I got on one knee in front of her and I confessed my love for her and that I officially wanted her to be my girlfriend. Her eyes didn’t glimmer at all, if anything she looked more repulsed by me, walking up snatching the bag of her gifts and the flowers walking off with it. I couldn't believe it. 
	I didnt think he would do all of that. I mean I was gonna have to talk to him at some point but to do that stunt in front of the entire school in the morning oh hell nah. He should have expected this. As I sat in bed eating the various of my favorite treats he had bought me I received a text on my phone. “Hey gorgeous, I'm sorry about all of that today I shouldnt have done any of that. If you come over tonight I have something special between the both of us and it will only be us and a surprise. I shouldn't have done that in front of everyone. I should of all people know that you like your privacy.” 
	Hmm maybe the apology was a 7/10 And I was tempted to go and to see what my surprise could possibly be but I got a really bad feeling deep down. Like a pit in my stomach screaming at me not to go. Whether it was greed and curiosity that pulled me there but before i knew it i had finished the crepes and I was outside heading to his place sending him a text once I had reached their home. It wasnt raining but their house had a gloomier look to it than it had before. Walking in I could hear wails from someone that sounded like they had been screaming for hours. Fully discovering the scene I could see the blood all over the walls. Gabrielle was laying in a pool of her own blood and the bloodied knife so close to her. 
	“Do you like my gift?” “What the fuck? You killed her! Why would you do that? Why did you drag me into this?!” He grabbed my arms, turning me to face him. “Because I love you. She was holding us back. I had to get rid of her.” I frown. “No you psycho it was you. You ruined things by taking it too far and you don't even realize.” I quickly snatched the knife off of the ground and I sliced a bit of his neck forcing him to move back farther from me. Looking further in the room I looked towards the dinner he had set up. It was a fucking seafood boil. He expected me to be able to eat a seafood boil in front of a dead body. “Please. Just get back with me. I love you.” Looking at him beg on his knees, his neck still bleeding. Staring harder into his face I could finally see it. The godforsaken scrunch. I stabbed the knife into his chest, twisting it seeing the look of pure agony mixed with that scrunch of his face. Now that he killed my victim he was gonna be my replacement for a little bit until I decide when to call the cops.</p>
