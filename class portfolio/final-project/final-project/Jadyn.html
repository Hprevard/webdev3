      <p class="">Producing behind his eyes was a bit difficult for her because she has to do it through Columbia for her BFA thesis, so there were parts of the project that she couldnt control. Relying on those around her she realized that when producing the story you have to be at the forefront making big decisions on the story, and the portrayal of characters.

      <p class=""> Jadyn believes that hollywood’s biggest failure right now is casting, making sure that casting includes representation. Looking at Annie from the movie Sinners that is a perfect example for perfect casting for a love interest making her a strong character that effected the plot really well and being an inspiration to female viewers. She feels like there can be a better job done by hollywood when it comes to making sure that black and poc stories and perspectives are shown and that we dont have to take on the responsibility ourselves.

Jadyn feels that any themes or truths about the experience of being black should be told. Especially when you’re making media that shows that we as black people are more than the monolith stereotypes that still affect us to this day.

      <p class="">It was a bit difficult to film fighting and emotional scenes for her movie behind our eyes. Trying to direct and guide her actors to deal with and to work with deep scenes and navigate through the awkwardness.

But with her experience she wants to continue her journey with going into more genres, more music videos, action, maybe tv shows as well. But she is planning a tv show pilot that focuses on a plot that is extremely similar to her life growing up in a predominantly white area and going to school in a more urban area experiencing more cultures she didn't experience back home.
