    The dabbler of many disciplines :graphic design, illustration, poetry, writing, ceramics, screen printing, fashion, painting etc. Blessed with the opportunity and resources to explore my artistic interests. From childhood they would get lost in their creations growing up in Pilsen, yet after teaching art at a camp they discovered their interest in art. Feeling a disconnect from their Mexican roots using art as a conduit.

    As a child they loved to make art loving the process realizing that they can make cool stuff, turning fun experiences into masterpieces from a young age. Using their art skills and love as an excuse to get out of class.

    As Gabi got older they realized that art can be cathartic used as an outlet. Approaching all disciplines with a visual in mind, metaphor soaked writing and in illustration. When drawing a series of illustration this one piece focused on a trans man plagued by religious trauma. The demon is a metaphor for religion, family, and societal pressure.

Considering ux design it’s hard for most to put their emotions and creativity in projects that aren’t personal yet Gabi still tries to find ways to insert their silliness into their projects.

As an artist first they use art as a tool to tell a story as it relates to them or for catharsis. Planning to make political and or societal pieces that make statements that relate to their experiences. Getting into painting to try to paint other people’s ideas or projections of others.

“I also think the art that makes me vulnerable that I put my raw self into I need to open myself up more and share it more and be more confident in what makes me me”
