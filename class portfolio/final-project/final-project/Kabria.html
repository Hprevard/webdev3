           <p>Growing up they loved how music felt through their body to where they would seek out music that would tickle their brain. Now they explore how they can make similar music with the inclusion of a rhythm, lyrics and mainly an experience. </p> </div>

      <p>Inspired to leave people in a state of confusion and shock. “When people dont quite get it” 
Feeling like you can impact someone with just a passing moment whether it is how she expresses herself. eerie , colorful , collaguesqe.

      <p>Being skilled in many different instruments but none of them to her meld well with the vision that she has. So her next project will include the tambourine and a kazoo on tracks based off of nursery rhymes because they are tactile instruments that also make very distinct sounds.

      <p>Despite the insanity of the last year she's come up with a concept for a song based on the nursery rhyme of eating worms but in this case she's willing to seek out someone's attention even if they pay for it. “In the unmarked location instead of eating worms im eating sperm.”

      <p>She wants to envoke the discomfort and unsettling feeling in those that witness her and her work wanting to be as eerie as the weird cartoons and tv shows that inspired her growing up like Dont hug me im scared, salad fingers, the weird side of youtube, melanie martinez, tyler the creator. She wants to create things similar to the media that inspired her mimicking the same themes and eerie vibes as well  <img src="img/Kabria14.jpg" class="">

      <p>Despite her current ambiguous relationship with God she cannot disrespect him in her lyrics in one of her songs talk about how inside of her there are fight forces where one where she thinks shes very innocent and cant do anything wrong and on the other hand they do sexual things resulting in their struggles with their view of themselves based on the morals placed on her growing up.

      <p>Being able to cut and paste had been a creative and fun way to develop her love for art growing up. Making and painting anime characters onto paper mache to make things. Collage work is difficult for her because it drags her outside her comfort zone of straight and rigidness. Exploring all of these avenues of basically finding things and putting them together she had learned the value of recycle art. Just making all of the jewelry that she wanted, the clothes. Its her favorite things of all time since it allows her to collect and buy things, turning them into something else. She recalls buying a bunch of squishmallows cutting them all up just to use them to make shoes for a character while everything else she didnt use went to other projects she worked on later.
